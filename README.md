#### Python Notes
- Lists are mutable</br>
Strings are "immutable" - you cannot change the contents of a string - you must make a new string to make any change</br>
List are "mutable" - you can change an element of a list using the index operator</br>

    List - A linear collection of values that stay in order</br>
    Key - Value</br>
    [0] = 21</br>
- Dictionary - A "bag" of values, each with its own label</br>
    Key - Value</br>
    {"candy": 3}</br> 
    The get() method is commonly used in dictionaries to see if a Key exists - see 'count_file.py'</br>
- Tuples are immutable</br>
    Unlike a List, once you create a Tuple, you cannot alter its contents - similar to a string.</br>
    Used for temporary variables, don't require to be modified, so they are simpler and more efficient in terms of memory use and preformance than Lists</br>
- Regular Expressions</br>
